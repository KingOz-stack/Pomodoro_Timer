# **Pomodoro Timer with a Ghibli Twist**  

## **Introduction**  
As a huge anime and Studio Ghibli fan, I wanted to create a Pomodoro Timer that not only helps with productivity but also brings a touch of my favorite Ghibli aesthetics to life. While there are numerous Pomodoro timers out there, this one stands out with its customizable background featuring Ghibli characters and animations!  

As a developer, I believe in building tools that resonate with me and customizing them to my tasteâ€”and now, you can experience it too.  

Feel free to check it out and use it for your own productive sessions!
